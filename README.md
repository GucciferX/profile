<Hello world, I'm Aaron.>

IÂ´m a full stack developer currently working on a web app named Remotescanner (https://www.remotescanner.work/)
A place where you can find remote & home-friendly jobs from different sites to save time browsing for offers and allowing users to store them all in one place.
